# **Hi there 👋**

## **We are tied to the organizations below**:

- [JDJG's Projects](https://github.com/JDsProjects/) (Manages)

## **Alternative Projects**
These are projects that don't get worked on much but are still available for collaboration.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

More importantly we manage JDJG's Random Tests and Such.
If you want to get access you'll need to access JDJG.
He'll decide whether or not you get permissions to read, write, etc.
He's also pretty strict on this.
